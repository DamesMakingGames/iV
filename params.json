","body":"# iV\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nCurrently in development by @jennie, @cecilycarver and @dxnn for Dames Making Games.\r\n\r\nBuilt with Daimio: https://github.com/dxnn/daimio\r\n\r\n### Support + Contact\r\nNeed help? Tweet at [@jennie](http://twitter.com/jennie), [@dann](http://twitter.com/dann), or [@cecilycarver](http://twitter.com/cecilycarver)\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n1. Install Node.js\r\n2. `$ git clone git@github.com:bentobx/iV.git`\r\n3. `$ npm install mongodb`\r\n4. `$ npm install socket.io`\r\n5. `$ node app.js`\r\n6. go to server.foo:8808\r\n\r\n## FAQ\r\n\r\n## Installing Node\r\n\r\nHead over to [nodejs.org] and click \"Install\" - a .pkg file will be downloaded. Open this file to run the installer.\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is the difference between ScreenPerfect and iV?\r\n\r\niV is a streamlined fork of ScreenPerfect built entirely in Daimio. It does not include the client/control (synchronous multi-screen) features of ScreenPerfect.\r\n\r\nIts development is driven by co-design and co-production principles. Our goal is to create an engine in collaboration with creators that addresses their need for quick prototyping tools, hackable interfaces, and control and ownership over their games' source code.\r\n\r\n### What kinds of games can I make with iV?\r\n\r\niV is good for making all sorts of browser-based interactive experiences, but is especially good at helping you make text-based interactive narratives, screen-by-screen adventure games, and full-motion-video games.\r\n\r\nYou can also (optionally) interact with and extend the engine by writing Daimio right inside the interface.\r\n\r\n## History\r\n\r\nScreenPerfect concept and development by Alex Leitch for Hannah Epstein's synchronous multi-screen/device installation game PsXXYborg. Additional development support by Dann Toliver (@dxnn). Interfaces and additional support by Jennie Faber (@jennie). [ScreenPerfect](https://github.com/pretentiousgit/screenperfect-dev) is built with Daimio: https://github.com/dxnn/daimio\r\n\r\nOriginating from a partnership between [Dames Making Games](http://dmg.to) and [OCADU's game:play Lab](http://research.ocadu.ca/gameplay/home), this format was prototyped at No Jam 2 in Toronto in November 2013. **VideoVideo** is a research-led game jam that takes FMV game-making tool ScreenPerfect, inspired by Hannah Epstein's synchronous multi-screen/device installation game [PsXXYborg](http://psxxyborg.com/), designed by [Alex Leitch](http://www.github.com/pretentiousgit) and built in collaboration with Dames Making Games using [Bento Box](http://bentobox.net)'s [Daimio](http://daimio.org) system for building creator-configurable applications. Part of [GRAND FRAGG](http://grand-nce.ca/research/projects/projectdata/fragg), VVJ develops tools built from a feminist perspective to facilitate new approaches and new voices in game making.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
