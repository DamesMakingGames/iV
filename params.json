Tweet at [@jennie](http://twitter.com/jennie), [@dann](http://twitter.com/dann), or [@cecilycarver](http://twitter.com/cecilycarver)\r\n\r\n<script data-gittip-username=\"ivengine\"\r\n        data-gittip-widget=\"button\"\r\n        src=\"//gttp.co/v1.js\"></script>\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n1. Install Node.js\r\n2. `$ git clone git@github.com:bentobx/iV.git`\r\n3. `$ npm install mongodb`\r\n4. `$ npm install socket.io`\r\n5. `$ node app.js`\r\n6. go to server.foo:8808\r\n\r\n## FAQ\r\n\r\n## Installing iV\r\n\r\nFirst, you'll need to install Node. Head over to [nodejs.org] and click \"Install\" - a .pkg file will be downloaded. Open this file to run the installer.\r\n\t\r\n## Making Your First iV Game\r\n\r\n1. Create a new game by giving it a name and clicking \"Add\"\r\n2. Click the \"Edit\" button.\r\n\r\nThis is the game editing interface.\r\n\r\nThe start screen for your game has been automatically created. You can edit its name and properties by clicking on its thumbnail in the room list on the left.\r\n\r\n## Room Types\r\n\r\nThere are three room types in iV. We'll cover image rooms for now: \r\n\r\n### Image\r\nAn **image** room takes a background image and allows the player to connect to other rooms by clicking on rectangular hotspots. \r\n\r\nFirst, set the background image by pasting a URL in the **Image URL** field. You can optionally specific\r\n\r\nTo add these links, select an existing room from the drop down under \"Add an Exit To:\"\r\n\r\nThis will add a box \r\n\r\niV games are made up of connecting \"Rooms.\" The player navigates through these rooms by clicking (or tapping, on touch-screen devices) on specific areas of the screen. When you're building your game, you can define these hot spots through text via wiki-like notation:\r\n\r\n`[[Room To Link To:Text To Display]]`\r\n\r\nMake text bold, italic, centered, red, whatever you want! Here you can also change an individual pageâ€™s background image.\r\n\r\n### Using Dropbox\r\n\r\nWhen using Dropbox to host and serve your files, you need to use the public URL to the file, rather than the URL you get by selecting \"Share Link.\"\r\n\r\nThe URL should look something like:\r\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12345678/filename.gif\r\n\r\n**NOT** like:\r\nhttps://dl-web.dropbox.com/get/filename.gif ...\r\n\r\nAdd files to you \"Public\" folder. Right click and select \"Copy public link\" You can check to ensure the file is accessible by logging out of Dropbox in your browser and entering the full URL in your address bar. If it loads there, it will load in your game.\r\n\r\n### What is the difference between ScreenPerfect and iV?\r\n\r\niV is a streamlined fork of ScreenPerfect built entirely in Daimio. It does not include the client/control (synchronous multi-screen) features of ScreenPerfect.\r\n\r\nIts development is driven by co-design and co-production principles. Our goal is to create an engine in collaboration with creators that addresses their need for quick prototyping tools, hackable interfaces, and control and ownership over their games' source code.\r\n\r\n### What kinds of games can I make with iV?\r\n\r\niV is good for making all sorts of browser-based interactive experiences, but is especially good at helping you make text-based interactive narratives, screen-by-screen adventure games, and full-motion-video games.\r\n\r\nYou can also (optionally) interact with and extend the engine by writing Daimio right inside the interface.\r\n\r\n## History\r\n\r\nScreenPerfect concept and development by Alex Leitch for Hannah Epstein's synchronous multi-screen/device installation game PsXXYborg. Additional development support by Dann Toliver (@dxnn). Interfaces and additional support by Jennie Faber (@jennie). [ScreenPerfect](https://github.com/pretentiousgit/screenperfect-dev) is built with Daimio: https://github.com/dxnn/daimio\r\n\r\nOriginating from a partnership between [Dames Making Games](http://dmg.to) and [OCADU's game:play Lab](http://research.ocadu.ca/gameplay/home), this format was prototyped at No Jam 2 in Toronto in November 2013. **VideoVideo** is a research-led game jam that takes FMV game-making tool ScreenPerfect, inspired by Hannah Epstein's synchronous multi-screen/device installation game [PsXXYborg](http://psxxyborg.com/), designed by [Alex Leitch](http://www.github.com/pretentiousgit) and built in collaboration with Dames Making Games using [Bento Box](http://bentobox.net)'s [Daimio](http://daimio.org) system for building creator-configurable applications. Part of [GRAND FRAGG](http://grand-nce.ca/research/projects/projectdata/fragg), VVJ develops tools built from a feminist perspective to facilitate new approaches and new voices in game making.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
